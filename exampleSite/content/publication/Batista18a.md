## Abstract
In order to transmit data efficiently over an optical network, many routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) algorithms have been proposed. This work presents a genetic algorithm that aims at solving the RWA problem, which consists of choosing the most suitable lightpath (i.e., a combination of a route and a wavelength channel) between a source-destination pair of nodes in all-optical networks. A comparison to some already known approaches in terms of blocking probability per load over four network topologies was made. Simulation results show a good performance, since the average blocking probability achieved by the proposed genetic algorithm was relatively equivalent to the values yielded by the standard approaches over two network topologies; and way lower on the other two networks.
